![alt tag](jqm4gwt-24x24.png) jqm4gwt   [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jqm4gwt/jqm4gwt.png)](https://travis-ci.org/jqm4gwt/jqm4gwt)
=======

jqm4gwt is an advanced wrapper over the jQuery Mobile framework, which transforms it into widget library
that can be used in a GWT application. This allows GWT developers to develop mobile web apps with and leverage
the vibrant jQuery Mobile widgets community without having to hand code javascript. In addition, projects that
currently leverage GWT can add a mobile channel with ease.

Note that because this project is a wrapper into Java, you do not have to invoke javascript native methods,
nor do you have to pass inline javascript to generic methods. You create widgets exactly as you do in the
normal GWT widgetset. In fact you don't have to have any understanding of how jQuery Mobile works behind
the scenes (although of course it helps if you do).

A quick example to create a jQuery Mobile enhanced button is: 
```java
JQMButton button = new JQMButton("Click me");
```
or the same as UiBinder template:
```xml
<ui:UiBinder xmlns:b="urn:import:com.sksamuel.jqm4gwt.button">
<b:JQMButton text="Click me" />
```

The project mirrors the release cycle of jQuery Mobile.
That is, when version x.y is released of JQM we try to then release version x.y of jqm4gwt to match.
Bug fixes in our code are released as x.y.z.

There is [full support for GWT's UiBinder](https://github.com/jqm4gwt/jqm4gwt/wiki/Using-jqm4gwt-with-UiBinder),
and a self-contained version of the module providing all of the dependent jQuery Mobile JavaScript, CSS, and images.

Jqm4gwt also provides a useful form framework that enables rapid prototyping of form pages, including ajax submission and validation.
See http://code.google.com/p/jqm4gwt/wiki/FormFramework

Examples
========

[Examples and demos are hosted on a google app engine instance](http://jqm4gwt.appspot.com/examples.html)

These include the typical hello world and a show case of jQuery Mobile widgets and events.

What's Supported
========

The full jQuery Mobile widget set is supported. That is pages, dialogs, popups, buttons, form elements, list boxes, navigation, etc.
Jqm4gwt goes further and supports standard GWT MVP constructs (Activities, Places, etc) and mixes that with the jQuery Mobile navigation system seemlessly.
jQuery Mobile is exposed to GWT users via both a simple [Fluent-style](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluent_interface) API and via
[GWT's UiBinder](https://developers.google.com/web-toolkit/doc/latest/DevGuideUiBinder).

Getting Started
========

Read the [quick start guide](https://github.com/jqm4gwt/jqm4gwt/wiki/Getting-Started). You will need to be familiar with GWT already.
